## Hello!
I'm **Erica Noronha**, a Brazilian front-end developer based in Rio de Janeiro. Bachelor of Information Systems undergraduate. I'm keen on supporting diversity initiatives and attending to events that help to create a more inclusive community. For the last couple years I have been getting experienced in technologies such as JavaScript (vanilla, jQuery, Angular, currently React and NextJS), WordPress CMS, VTEX SaaS. I'm always open to learn new stuff. :relaxed:
